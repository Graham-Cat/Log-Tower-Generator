# Log-Tower-Generator
Algebraic structure of logarithmic functions of the form A(x)=h(x)⋅ln(g(x))/ln(f(x)) via discovery of a stable F/G‑sector symmetry, a closed family of derivative modules, and a block‑triangular operator algebra. Potential applications are symbolic computation, asymptotic analysis, and series expansions relevant to mathematical physics.
